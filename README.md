# This repository has Moved!

  Due to the fact that GitHub is hosting the files on privately owned
  servers located in the USA, this repository has been moved to
  [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ormf/cellctl/) in November of
  2025. It will not receive further updates or patches. Issues and
  pull requests will not be looked at here either, please submit your
  patches and issue tickets on Codeberg, or send them directly via
  good old email patches to the author.

Thanks.
